# Movement-Classification-based-on-Electroencephalography-EEG-Signals
Final project for ECE239AS Deep Learning and Neural Network at UCLA, Winter 2019

- Performed CNN, RNN, RNN with Attention, GAN (use the discriminator) for movement classification based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals

- Filtered and subsampled the original dataset for further improvement

- Obtained 66.5% best validation accuracy for CNN, as well as 65.3% for RNN

- Dataset description: http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/desc_2a.pdf

- The original dataset can be found through http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/. The actual dataset we use for this project is reformatted by the instructor, and "these datasets are internal for this class and should not be distributed".
