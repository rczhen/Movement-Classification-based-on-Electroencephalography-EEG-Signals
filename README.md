# Movement-Classification-based-on-Electroencephalography-EEG-Signals
Final project for ECE239AS Deep Learning and Neural Network at UCLA, Winter 2019

- Performed CNN, RNN, RNN with Attention, GAN (use the discriminator) for movement classification based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals

- Filtered and subsampled the original dataset for further improvement

- Obtained 66.5% best validation accuracy for CNN, as well as 65.3% for RNN
